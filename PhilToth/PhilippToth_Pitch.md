# Philipp Toth - Pitch

## 15-Minutes

Hi, I’m Philipp Toth, a passionate software developer with a strong foundation in web technologies and test automation. I’ve been working at Schuhfried GmbH, a company specializing in psychometric testing systems, since 2022.

My work focuses on implementing, migrating, and maintaining test systems built with JavaScript, jQuery, HTML/CSS, and ASP.NET MVC. I also design and maintain automated testing environments using Playwright and JavaScript to ensure reliability and performance. Collaborating with backend developers using C#, ASP.NET, and PowerShell has given me a holistic view of the entire software lifecycle—from concept to deployment.

Before entering software development, I gained practical experience in service-oriented environments, working for Congress Casino Baden and later completing civil service at the Peterhof Klinikum, where I learned the value of teamwork, patience, and communication.

I graduated from HTL Mödling with a degree in Electronics and Technical Informatics. My education and career share a common theme: curiosity, adaptability, and a drive to learn continuously. I’m fluent in German, have a strong command of English (B2), and basic Spanish (A2).

Beyond coding, I’m passionate about music, technology, and audio engineering—I enjoy creating guitar recordings and exploring sound design. I believe creativity fuels problem-solving, and I bring that same energy into my development work.

My goal is to continue growing as a developer in a dynamic team where I can contribute technically while also learning from others. I value collaboration, precision, and a friendly work culture that encourages innovation.
